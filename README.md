## Menopaws ##

### Background ###

This is a cross-platform mobile app written in Xamarin to help menopausal women track symptoms and their potential triggers.

This was created as part of [Hack Manchester 2017](https://www.hac100.com/event/hack-mcr-17/)

This version of the master branch has been reset to the point that we branched from it after moving away from SyncFusion
